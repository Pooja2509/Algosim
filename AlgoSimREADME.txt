Problem statement..
The visualisation of data structures and algorithm
is a very tedious task to represent..

Using AlgoSim I have tried to visualise the DS/Algo.

Using generic containers to represent data. I have tried to use them
in different scenes for a specific algorithm, 
The data values of the structures can be fed initially and
The Algorithm can be run over the DS, everything which is happening with
variables are visiblle by applying animation/motion over 
the corresponding represented 3D objects...
